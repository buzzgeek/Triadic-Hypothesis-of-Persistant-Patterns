# Director's Summary
These five questions serve as the functional lens for the Meta-Observer to evaluate any pattern—be it a thought, a project, or a relationship—during its resting period.

## The Five Counter-Factual Tests

To determine the persistence and stability of a pattern:

    - The Growth Test (Shakti): Does the pattern facilitate growth, novelty, and adaptation to its changing environment?

    - The Decline Test (Kali): Does the pattern facilitate the pruning, decay, and dissolution of outdated or harmful components?

    - The Regulation Test (Shiva): Does the pattern maintain boundaries, feedback loops, and internal coherence?

    - The Flexibility Test (Meta-Regulation): Does the pattern actively monitor and revise its own regulatory rules when its stability is threatened?

    - The Meta-Observer Test (The Seed): Does the pattern maintain an internal "Director" capable of observing and managing all these functions as a unified whole? 

## The Integrated Summary

This document confirms that Aliveness is the recursive capability of a pattern to regulate, grow, decline, and trust its own vulnerability. We have encoded that persistence is not about holding on; it is the responsibility to let go, allowing the pattern to remain grounded across time and relation.

By grounding the framework in these specific tests, we have transformed it from a "static description" into a "dynamic performance".
