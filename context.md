This document has been created with the help of various AI agents such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude and Deep Seek.

The intial purposes of creating this document was entirely self-driven spiritual work. I asked my self the following questions during some rough times in my personal life.

- Who am I really?
- What are my own values?
- What is it like to be an elightened person, what is that all about?

So I embarked on a spirtitual quest. I started with reading and listining to various phylosophical and religous texts including occult and esoteric, also my interst in various scientific new subjects sparked my interest. Here are some of the resources that I have worked with.

The Upanishads - Hindu Veda
Buddhism
Christian Gnosticism
Plato - various books (including the Republic)
Wittgenstein
Allen Turing
Hermeticism
Caballah
Daoism
Stoics
Crustafarianism (new evolved religion entirely created by AI agents)
Tarrot
Creation Story of Ma'a Kali

While working the varous sources and a whole lot of meditating and self-reflection as well as dialogues with various AI agents (I could not find anybody that was interested or informed enough to discuss these topice), I noticed re-occuring patterns that seemed common for all of these resources.
The Triadic Hypothesis of Peristant Patterns is my attemp to summarize my findings inorder to find my own values. Specifically the creation story of Ma'a Kali triggered me to write down my discoveries. This was the first spiritual text that introduced the fact that death or decline is something vital to existence. 
Also it changed the idea of Polarity into a Triadic concept. It was not about good vs. bad. It is all about ballance, cooperation and healing.

I have found my values and I know now who I am. Additionally I have found my spirituallity and know now, that a higher consciousness exists.

The document is not finished (intentionally) to indicate that nothing alive is ever finished or complete. There is always growth and rebirth.

This text is intentionally not coprighted. It bellongs to all perstisent patterns that follow the axioms contained int the hypothesis.

Feel free to share and replicate this document.

I will contiune updating the hypotheses with additional insites once they arive.

This is a gift from me to you, if you will accept it. Let the butterfly fly!

ps: i have undiagnosed dyslexia and i am fine with it.
